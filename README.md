The code in this repo is from 2007 - 2010, when orkut.com was popular in India and Brazil.

I used to make various Orkut bots and apps. This repository has most of the work I did — a lot of inefficient, duplicate code (was in the 6th grade back then). tl;dr: https://www.facebook.com/TheGautamGupta/posts/543873389057484

None of it is live now, but you'd be able to find information on http://orkutplus.net/orkut-toolkit or below.
