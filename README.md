From 2007 - 2010, when orkut.com was popular in India and Brazil.

I used to make various Orkut bots and apps. This repository has most of the work I did -- a lot of inefficient, duplicate code (was in the 6th grade back then). None of it is live now, but you'd be able to find information and screenshots on http://www.orkutplus.net/
